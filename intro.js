/* JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine ("host environment").

Weakly typed languages assign types (like "number") to variables (data containters) at runtime - i.e. we cant set the types we want to use in certain places in advance. Only indirectly by making sure we are always working with the correct values. 

JavaScript was created to make webpages more dynamic (e.g. change content on a page directly from inside the browser). 

VARIABLE is a DATA CONTAINER or DATA STORAGE where the value can change.

CONSTANTS are also DATA CONTAINERS or DATA STORAGES where the value MUST NOT CHANGE.

We should use constants as ofthen as possible (i.e. whenever you actually got data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code).
